Data Model
============

Using Table, List Data Models and View Widgets
------------------------------------------------

- In PyQt5, the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is employed to handle data models.

- This pattern divides the functionality of a user interface into three separate segments â€“ model, view, and controller, enabling the independent development of each part.

- PyQt5's ``QAbstractTableModel`` and ``QAbstractListModel`` are classes that implement the model segment of this pattern.

  - ``QAbstractTableModel`` is used to represent a 2-dimensional data structure, i.e., data composed of rows and columns.

  - ``QAbstractListModel`` represents a 1-dimensional data structure, like a list or an array consisting of consecutive items.
