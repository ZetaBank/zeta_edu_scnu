Overall Explanation
====================

Overview
---------

FaceDetect is a deep learning-based object detection model that focuses on identifying faces in images or videos.
This model plays a crucial role in various applications, such as security systems, facial recognition, and social media platforms.
FaceDetect can be trained on large datasets containing annotated images of faces in different environments, lighting conditions, and poses, improving its accuracy and effectiveness.

As you may have noticed, we have a face detection method, FaceDetect, in our "follow along" step.


FaceDetect 
--------------------
FaceDetect is primarily designed for detecting faces in images and videos.
It utilizes deep neural network architectures such as NVIDIA DetectNet_v2 detector with ResNet18 as a feature extractor to process and analyze input data.
These networks are trained on vast datasets containing images with annotated faces, allowing them to learn and recognize facial features and expressions.

During the training process, FaceDetect learns to identify and distinguish between faces and other objects in the scene.
This enables it to generate accurate bounding boxes around faces in images or videos, even in challenging environments with multiple faces, occlusions, or varying lighting conditions.

The advantage of using FaceDetect for face detection is that it can achieve high accuracy in detecting faces while maintaining reasonable computational requirements.
This makes it suitable for applications where real-time processing is essential, such as surveillance systems, facial recognition, and smart cities.

Overall, FaceDetect's ability to effectively detect faces in various scenarios makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of computer vision applications.
