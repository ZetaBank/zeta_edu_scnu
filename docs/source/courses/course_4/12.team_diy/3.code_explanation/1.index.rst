Code Explanation
==================

With our follow along examples, we were able to move our robot arm with precision as well as produce music with our 
integrated speaker within the zetabot. The instructional codes have been compile into a jupyter notebook for the 
ease of use. 
This section will explain the libraries used for the *follow along* section. 


Sound
-------------------------------

For our dancing robot demonstration, we published an array of integer to ROS Topic called ``/play_specific``. 

The ``play_specific`` topic publishes messages to the play_sound node. You can play a sound file by entering the absolute path of the sound file.
