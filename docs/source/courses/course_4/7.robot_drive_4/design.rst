Purpose : 
    - Robots are devices meant to help humans.
    - The autonomous driving function is a function to support major functions.
    - It is important that the main function and autonomous driving function are harmonized and do not conflict with each other.
    - We started this project with the goal of creating more interest in robots.

What to do : 
    - Robots are already being used in a variety of fields.
    - Decide on the field you want to use. The purpose of use, such as manufacturing or medical fields, must be determined.
    - You need to decide what function you want to perform in a given field.
    - Think about the sensors and devices you need to attach to perform the task.
    - Designing a Robot

You don’t have to be exact, and you don’t have to worry too much.
We wanted to give you a sense of the joy that designing robots can bring.
We hope that your current concerns about what kind of robot to make will help you make future career decisions.
