Topic: 
    1. Components of the robot.
        1. How can robots be used in educational settings to engage students, teach coding and programming, and provide personalized learning experiences?
        2. How will transportation systems and urban planning change with the development of self-driving technologies such as self-driving cars and drones?
        3. Is there a way to combine robotics and art, using robots to create new forms of artistic expression, such as interactive installations and kinetic sculptures?
        4. How will robots contribute to space exploration in space exploration, such as planetary probes and autonomous satellites?
        5. How will robotics be applied in the medical field, including robotic aids, prosthetics and rehabilitation devices for individuals with mobility impairments?
        6. How can robots and automation be applied to tasks such as growing, harvesting, and monitoring crop health to improve production efficiency and growing conditions in agriculture?
        7. What are the potential implications for robotics and industrial automation given the current state of ROS 2 applications and how ROS 2 might shape these sectors?
        8. How will the integration of fifth generation (5G) communication technologies affect robotics and the ROS ecosystem?
        9. What are some examples of use of ROS in medical robotics and applications, such as surgical assistance, medical image analysis, and patient monitoring?
        10. What is the role and application of ROS in drone technology, drone control, autonomous flight, environmental awareness, etc.?

    2. Robot assembly status by team.
        Complete the assembly of the robot within the time limit of 2 hours and draw a circle using the joystick!
        
        Tips:
            1. Check if each function of the robot is working properly.
            2. Check that the motor is working properly, the camera and lidar are working well, and there are no abnormalities in the sensors.
            3. Check once again that the screws are not assembled or are not loose.
