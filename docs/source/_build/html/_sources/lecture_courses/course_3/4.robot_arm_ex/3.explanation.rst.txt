Tracking a Color or a Face
------------------------------

Within our *follow along* examples, we follow a tracking examples, where our robot arm would track either track a color 
or track our face.
In order to achieve this we implore three important steps

1. Input processing
2. Processing and instructing the arm to move towards the detected a color or a face.
3. Displaying the results. 

The detection as well as imput/ output image processing was handled by ``cv2`` library from OpenCV.
The movement of the robot arm was handled by the custom made proportianal integral derivative controller 
as well as the ``Arm_Lib`` library.
