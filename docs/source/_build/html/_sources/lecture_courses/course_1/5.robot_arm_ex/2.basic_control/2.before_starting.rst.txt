-   Currently, the robot arm can only be moved with a controller.


-   We need to shut down the container that controls the robot arm controller in order to control the robot arm with code.


-   Click the "zetabankhub/edu:melodic-dofbot-" in green text.

-   If the container is in RUNNING state, press stop and wait for a while.


-   The "zetabankhub/edu:melodic-dofbot-" text turns white when the container is shutting down.

-   Now, let's use jupyterhub to control the robot arm using code.


-   Conversely, if you want to control the robot wave using the controller, you can start the "zetabankhub/edu:melodic-dofbot-" container.
