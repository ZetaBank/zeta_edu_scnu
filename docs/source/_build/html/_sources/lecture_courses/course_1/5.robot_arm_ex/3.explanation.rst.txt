Overall Explanation
====================

With our follow along examples, we were able to move our robot arm with precision as well as produce music with our 
integrated speaker within the zetabot. The instructional codes have been compile into a jupyter notebook for the 
ease of use. 
This section will explain the libraries used for the *follow along* section. 


Robot Arm Movements
---------------------

The instructions given to the robot arm are within Python 2 environment. We use ``Arm_Lib`` library
which contains all the necessary modules that we use to operate our robot arm. 
``Arm_Lib`` is a library provided by the Yahboom Robotics where our robot arm was made.
