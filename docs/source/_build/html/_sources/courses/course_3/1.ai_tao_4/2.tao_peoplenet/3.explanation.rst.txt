Overall Explanation
====================

Overview
---------

PeopleNet is a deep learning-based object detection model that focuses on identifying and tracking people in images or videos.
This model plays a crucial role in various applications, such as surveillance, crowd management, and public safety.
PeopleNet can be trained on large datasets containing annotated images of people in different environments and poses, improving its accuracy and effectiveness.


As you may have noticed, we have person detection and tracking method, PeopleNet, in our "follow along" step.


PeopleNet 
--------------------

PeopleNet is primarily designed for detecting and tracking people in images and videos.
It utilizes deep neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process and analyze input data.
These networks are trained on vast datasets containing images with annotated people, allowing them to learn and recognize human features, poses, and activities.


During the training process, PeopleNet learns to identify and distinguish between people and other objects in the scene.
This enables it to generate accurate bounding boxes around individuals in images or videos, even in challenging environments with multiple people or varying lighting conditions.


The advantage of using PeopleNet for people detection and tracking is that it can achieve high accuracy in detecting individuals while maintaining reasonable computational requirements.
This makes it suitable for applications where real-time processing is essential, such as surveillance systems, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles.


Overall, PeopleNet's ability to effectively detect and track people in various scenarios makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of computer vision applications.
