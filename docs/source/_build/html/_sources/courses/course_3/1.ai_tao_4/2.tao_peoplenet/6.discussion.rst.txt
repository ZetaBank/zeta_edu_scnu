=============

The PeopleNet system allows us to detect and recognize people in various environments. Through our examples, we were able to see how the system can be applied to a variety of different applications.

                If you could enhance the PeopleNet system, what additional features or applications would you like to incorporate?

                How would you train your PeopleNet model for a specific use case?

                        When creating a machine learning model, we need a model architecture and data to train the said architecture.
                        Depending on the application, we may import a pre-trained PeopleNet model but fine-tune it with our own data for our specific task.
                        For example, for detecting and tracking people in a retail environment, we would need multiple surveillance videos that are labeled by professionals to train our model.
                        This would help the model to better recognize people in a specific context and improve its overall performance.

                What potential ethical concerns or privacy issues might arise when using PeopleNet in certain scenarios, and how can they be addressed?
