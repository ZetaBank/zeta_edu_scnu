Creating Modal and Modeless Dialogs
===================================

Modal Dialogs
-------------

- The user cannot interact with the main window until the dialog is closed.
  
- Typically used for critical information or decisions that require the user's focus.

Modeless Dialogs
----------------

- Even if the dialog is open, the user can interact with the main window simultaneously.
