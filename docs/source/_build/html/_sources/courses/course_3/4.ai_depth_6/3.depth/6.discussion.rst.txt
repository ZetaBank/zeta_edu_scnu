                What challenges might arise when integrating DepthNet into a new application?
                <ul>
                    <li> For DepthNet to be effective, high-quality training data is essential. For instance, if we want to use it for indoor robot navigation, we need datasets comprising diverse indoor scenes. How would you gather and curate such data?</li>
