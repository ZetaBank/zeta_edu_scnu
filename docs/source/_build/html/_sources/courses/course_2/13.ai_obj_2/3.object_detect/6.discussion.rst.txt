                <strong>Potential Applications:</strong> Imagining the broad capabilities of object detection systems, if you were to integrate such a system into a consumer product, what would it be? Examples:
                <ul>
                    <li>Foot Traffic Analysis: Understand pedestrian flow in urban settings.</li>
                    <li>Airport Security System: Enhance security by detecting suspicious objects or activities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Improving the System:</strong> Consider possible enhancements for the Detect Object system. What additional features or refinements would you suggest?</li>
        </ul>
