The Background Removal and Replacement system allows us to remove the background from an image or video stream and replace it with a different background.
This can be useful for various applications such as video conferencing, virtual sets, and special effects in movies.

                If you were to apply this system to a consumer product, what kind of product would that be? For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Virtual Background for Video Conferencing</li>
                    <li>Augmented Reality Filters for Social Media</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> If you could improve or add to the Background Removal and Replacement system, what would it be?</li>
