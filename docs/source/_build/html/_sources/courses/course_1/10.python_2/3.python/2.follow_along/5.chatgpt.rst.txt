8. Here is the code we wrote with the help of ChatGPT.

.. code-block:: python

    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(a, b):
        return a - b

    def multiply(a, b):
        return a * b

    def divide(a, b):
        if b != 0:
            return a / b
        else:
            return "Error: Division by zero"

    # 사용자로부터 입력 받기
    a = float(input("첫 번째 숫자 입력: "))
    b = float(input("두 번째 숫자 입력: "))

    # 각 사칙연산 수행
    print(f"{a} + {b} = {add(a, b)}")
    print(f"{a} - {b} = {subtract(a, b)}")
    print(f"{a} * {b} = {multiply(a, b)}")
    print(f"{a} / {b} = {divide(a, b)}")

9. Now, let's write the code in earnest with the help of ChatGPT.

    Examples:

        1. Chatbot Basics: Write a Python code to create a simple chatbot that greets the user and responds to a few predefined questions.

        2. Number Guessing Game: Develop a program using Python where the computer selects a random number, and the user has to guess it. Provide hints like "higher" or "lower" based on user input.

        3. Image Recognition: Use a Python library like OpenCV to build a basic image recognition program that can distinguish between images containing cats and dogs.

        4. Calculator with AI: Create a calculator in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations and answers questions like "What's the square root of 25?" using appropriate math functions.

        5. Language Translation: Write a Python script that contains a dictionary of English words and their translations. Convert a user-entered sentence from English to another language using this dictionary.

        6. Sentiment Analysis: Develop a simple sentiment analysis program in Python that takes a user's input (text) and determines sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral based on predefined keywords.
